\chapter{Spatial Kappa Translator User Guide}

\section{Obtaining the application}

The application is available from GitHub as the source Eclipse project, or as a single executable jar file. Both are available at \url{https://github.com/DemonSoftUK/SpatialKappa-PSD2}.

\section{Using the translator}

The translator converts Kappa model files from the current version of Spatial Kappa (v2.0.0) to the version of Kappa supported by the current release of KaSim (v2.01). It takes a single input kappa file and an optional output file name.

The generated output file can then be simulated using KaSim.

\subsection{Running the executable jar}

The simulator can be started by running the executable jar file:\\
\verb|java -jar SpatialKappaTranslator-v2.0.0.jar  <input file path> [<output file path>]|\\\\
Double clicking the jar file usually works too.

\subsection{Running from the Eclipse project}

The main class of the simulator is \\
\verb|org.demonsoft.spatialkappa.tools.SpatialTranslator|\\\\
Running as a Java Application with the command line arguments\\ \verb|<input file path> [<output file path>]| will execute the translator.
