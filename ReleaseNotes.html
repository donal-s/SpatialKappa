<h4>Summary of additions for v2.0.5</h4>

<p>Added variable transition rates based on the composition of the complexes selected for the transition.</p>

<h4>Summary of additions for v2.0.4</h4>

<p>Can now use selected predefined compartments and channels, in 2 and 3D.</p>

<h4>Summary of additions for v2.0.3</h4>

<p>Interim release.</p>

<h4>Summary of additions for v2.0.2</h4>

<p>Interim release.</p>

<h4>Summary of additions for v2.0.1</h4>

<p>%channel: declarations are now more consistent and logical. Can be composed of multiple forward only 
expressions. No need to have multiple declarations using the same channel name.</p>

<h4>Summary of additions for v2.0.0</h4>

<p>%link: declarations are now %channel: declarations.</p>
<p>Channel and compartments names are now ids rather than labels, so no need to use single quotes.</p>
<p>%init:, %obs:, %var: declarations and transform rules can now specify location. Agents can also specify location.</p>
<p>Agent links can specify channel to define multi-voxel complexes.</p>

<p>An issues and bug tracker will appear eventually. For now, please
email any bug reports or feature requests to <a
	href="mailto:spatialkappa@demonsoft.org">spatialkappa@demonsoft.org</a>.</p>

<h4>Known issues</h4>

<p>Validation of invalid models not catching all errors cleanly - requires some extension.</p>
<p>Transform rules limited to single merged complex (on left or right).</p>
<p>Issue handling the transform rule A() -> B() @ 1.0</p>
<p>When specifying channel locations ensure there is a space before the '-' operator, eg. cytosol[x][y -1].</p>
